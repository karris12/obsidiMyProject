How it works:
Main Menu Loop:
The while loop presents a menu to the user with options to view the towns, restaurants, 
or interesting places in Toronto. The user can also exit the program.

Populating Data:
The lists are populated using methods (populateTowns(), populateRestaurants(), 
populatePlaces()), which add predefined data to the lists.

Input Validation:
The method getValidChoice() ensures that the user input is valid (between 1 and 4). 
If the user enters an invalid choice, it prompts them again.

Displaying Data:
Once the user selects a valid option, the displayList() method is called to show the 
respective data (towns, restaurants, or places).

Exit Option:
The user can select "4" to exit the application, and it will display a goodbye message.

Next Steps:
Enhance the UI: You can enhance the user interface or create a more complex layout, 
but for a simple console-based app, this should work as a great starting point.
Implement SOLID principles: We have already applied the Single Responsibility Principle 
(SRP) in creating separate methods for different functionalities 
(data population, display, input validation). 
If needed, you can split the methods further for more specific tasks.
